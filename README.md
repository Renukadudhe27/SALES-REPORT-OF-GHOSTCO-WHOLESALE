According to Mr. Scare’s requirements, the given data set is analyzed, and a report is prepared which affect the sales of the GhostCo Wholesale.
By using Tableau and Pivot table the given data set is visualized, and analyzed by taking a glance at the Charts and Graphs and overall perception of the whole set of data can be understood easily.
1. For each segment, fashion quantity is higher.
➢ Considering the above data visualization between Segment, Product Category and Quantity sold it’s clear that the quantity in fashion category is maximum among the three segments consumer, corporate and home office.
➢ Looking at the above graph, we can say that people are using more fashion products in any sector. The reason for this can be these products are an integral part of daily life as compared to other categories. The product in other categories are usually long
lasting products and people invest them once in a while unlike fashion products which are bought often.
➢ One of the ideas for GhostCo to increase its sales of other category products is providing some concessions on those units or reducing the prices for steady growth of the sales.
2. Average shipping cost for products
➢ Considering the above data visualization between Product, Product Category and average shipping we can find the least and the maximum shipping cost in each product category. For auto – max is tyres and min is car seat covers, for electronic – max is apple laptop and min is keyboard, for fashion – max is t-shirts and min is sportswear, for home and furniture -max is towels and min is curtains.
➢ The reason for higher average shipping costs for apple laptop , t-shirts, towels and tyres is as they are used in everyday basis and are in high demand for the customers.
➢ These costs should be fixed depending upon the delivery stations and shipping mode.
3. Fashion in top countries in NA – Canada, US, Mexico
➢ Considering the above data visualization between 3 largest countries in NA and average sales of fashion products it’s clear that the sales are maximum in Canada.
➢ The reason for this can be the more diversity of people staying there over a large area.
➢ The average sales in these countries are around similar. Different types of cultural and traditional fashion products can be sold for steady growth of the sales.
4. Fashion profit at 2 famous cities monthly
➢ Considering the above data visualization between 2 famous cities in US and India and fashion profits we can see that for some of the month’s profits are higher in Mumbai than while New York city has non-fluctuating profits.
➢ The fluctuation in Mumbai’s fashion profit can be because of the different festivals celebrated between months and due to weather change.
➢ NYC has pretty consistent profits throughout the year whereas in Mumbai profits can be increased by providing deal and offers on fashion products during non-seasonal/festive months.
5. Ship mode and sum of shipping cost
➢ Considering the above data visualization between ship mode and shipping cost we can see that for standard class mode the shipping cost earned is maximum and for same day mode the shipping cost earned is the least.
➢ People generally prefer less cost for delivery and shipping of the products. And hence they opt for standard class. Even if the shipping cost is low for standard class, maximum people opt for it which ultimately increases the company’s total earning from shipping cost.
➢ The company should keep less margin between the different shipping modes so that they can earn from other modes as well.
6. Regions and total sales
➢ The above visualization shows the sum of sales in different regions with visuals of product category. According to this, the sales are maximum in Central and least in Canada region.
➢ The availability of stores, manufacturing units and inventory of products could be the reason why the sales are higher in Central region and not in other areas.
➢ The shipping method and routes of delivery should be modified so as to increase reachability of products and the number of sales.
7. Segment monthly sales
➢ The above visualization shows the consumer has the highest sales and home office has the least sales with similar monthly trends. In January, trends were higher for all three segments and then they reduced for the next month together.
8. Home & Furniture sales
➢ The above graph shows the sales of different home and furniture products. It shows that towels, sofa covers and bedsheets have the highest sales.
➢ These things are frequently used in household for doing different tasks. Hence are in continuous demand. This is the reason that customers buy the above products in large quantities.
➢ To raise the sales of other things , they can be sold in sets and combos so that customers can prefer buying them.
